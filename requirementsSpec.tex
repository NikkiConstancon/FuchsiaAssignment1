	\section{Introduction}
    	
        \subsection{Purpose}
        	\paragraph{The purpose of this document is to put forth a description detailing the NavUP system. It will explain the main purpose of the system, as well as additional subsystems, the interface of these systems, and what they will and will not do, as well as the constraints. Providing a detailed requirement specification of the system as a whole. It is intended for the Client, as well as developers who will integrate the system.}
    	\subsection{Scope}
        	\paragraph{NavUP will be a mobile device application, that will provide the basic functionalities of a navigation system. The system will only interoperate and function on the Hatfield main campus of the University of Pretoria.  	NavUp will provide a means to navigate the main campus of the University of Pretoria. It will thus provide users choices with regards to which routes they wish to take to reach there destination, taking into account factors such as pedestrian and vehicle traffic as well as providing routes that cater to users who may suffer physical disabilities.  NavUP's goal is to provide a personalised, efficient and convenient means of traversing the university's Hatfield campus. The system will also provide extra additional information regarding useful points of interests such as bathroom locations, as well as provide information to the user regarding the rich history of the University of Pretoria. The navigation system will be required to constantly be connected the the campus's WI-FI and will continually send up and down stream information to a server with regards to users location and destination. The server will be required to calculate the route and factor in additional information as set up by the user and there needs. The server must also be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users and provide them all with there required data. Location tracking will be achieved through the use of --WI-FI signal strength and other : not sure of exact methodology-- techniques and not through the use of GPS. /* This means that the two way communication between the device and the server must --explain requirements here-- */ }

        	\subsubsection{System Interface}
            \subsubsection{User Interface}
	    {All users will have access to the navigation system when the application is launched.
They will be able to enter a destination and follow the path to location/lecture hall specified(see Figure 1).
The users will also be able to select preferences such as disability access path, which will enable them to travel the path with ease.\\\\
The users will be able to view information each building, giving them additional historic information about the building(Figure 2). If they do not not wish to 
view information about the building, they must simply not click on the information symbol available.
They will also be allowed to view each room. The navigation system will allow the users to select points of interest, such as food dispensaries, 
smoking locations, and toilets. They will be able to turn on and off indicators for these points of interest.
The users may access a view to heat paths on the map, to show an increase in crowd population in a dense area.\\\\
For the account user interface, the registered students and employees will be able to login to their account, using their clickUP information.
There will be certain accounts with administrative privileges that will be able to create and delete accounts, as deemed necessary.\\\\
The application will be able to send users notifications, on events that occur on campus as well as a report of information, such as the amount of 
steps walked per week. Students and employees will be able to remove push notifications, if they do not wish to receive them from the system.\\\\

            \subsubsection{Operations}
            	\paragraph{The user will require a series of normal and special case operations to be fulfilled by the system. The user will use the system in normal case operations that comprise of finding the users location, finding a location the user is interested in, including locations such as toilets, and navigating, tracking and guiding the user to these locations. The user will also use the system to save locations of interest for future use as well as check extra information for improved path finding, such as pedestrian traffic, distance or vehicle traffic.\\\\
            	The system will consist of three modes of operation. One  being a general case of functionality, available to all users, that provides wayfinding capabilities to all users of the system. The other being a logged in operational mode which allows access to additional features such as account management, route sharing and rating and data storage. The final mode being a special mode of operation that will be an administrative mode. This mode allows the user to generate and manage events, update and maintain the system as well as generate notifications that will be received by other users.\\\\
            	Special modes of operation will involve the system pushing user specific information to the user device that may interest them or might require a route recalculation by the system due to environmental changes, such as pedestrian traffic flow or event related locations of interest as set out by the administrative user. Another special mode of operation is the systems ability to generate interesting facts for the user about locations found on campus, which will be useful to generals users who have an interest in history, while not being intrusive to users who do not care for the operation.\\\\
            	The general user will primarily use the system in en-route to various locations. This will primarily take place between periods of the University time table. Other periods will primarily see the system being used by students with an off period or by visitors and lecturers. The system will see unattended periods of operations while a user is actually walking and being tracked by the system. Further unattended periods of operations will occur when the Server pushes relevant data regarding events and user preferences to the user device.\\\\
            	The user will be able to view live heat maps of the main campus which allow them to gauge where the most pedestrian traffic is and avoid those routes. The system will also provide a mode which highlights features such as wheelchair ramps and other facilities that enable an easier means of navigating the campus. The system will by default select routes that it has calculated to be the most direct, however the user may choose to set the route navigation into other modes which select the highest ranked routes, the scenic routes or the users saved routes. Points of interest can also be searched for and ordered and filtered by rating and distance.\\\\
            	The system will provide a registered user the option to either save there data, such as preferences, locally on the device or remotely on the server. The system will also provide administrative users methods for backing up the system and several different forms of readouts, reports and tabulations regarding the state and use of the system which can be gathered at an annual or intermittent period and backed up for analysis.}
            \subsubsection{Sit Adaption Requirements}
        
		\subsection{Product Functions} \paragraph{The main function of the NavUP system will be to show students how to get around campus in the shortest possible way. Thus, this will entail using WiFi, mobile networks and possibly GPS to navigate around Hatfield campus. The basic functions will include:  }
	\begin{itemize}
  		\item A heat map to show pedestrian traffic.
		\item Providing the shortest path from point A to point B.
 		 \item A distance tracker to show users the distance left until they reach their destination.
		\item A specialized route for disabled users.
		\item Points of interest around the university such as restaurants, ATMs, the church, Scienza and Botanical Gardens.
 		 \item Essential Areas such as bathrooms, parking areas and smoking areas.
		\item Exact locations of buildings as well as the lecture halls that they consist of.
		\item A "Where am i?" function to show users exactly what is around them.
 		 \item Historical backgrounds of buildings and different parts of campus.
		\item A login page for users who would like access to more of the personalised functions. Theses functions will be saving locations for future use, a game which rewards users when they reach a certain distance and saving user preferences and interests.
		\item A random facts generator for distance rewards.
		\item Switching between WiFi, mobile data and GPS to navigate around campus.
		\item A timetable function for users to input their timetables and show exactly where their lectures will take place with reminders.
		\item Provide adminitrative security for login functionality.
		\item Rating system and review for restaurants and parking.
		\item Route options such as scenic routes and fastest route.
		\item Ability to share directions as well as estimated time of arrival.
