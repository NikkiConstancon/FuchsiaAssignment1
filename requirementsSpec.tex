	\section{Introduction}
    	
        \subsection{Purpose}
        	\paragraph{The purpose of this document is to put forth a description detailing the NavUP system. It will explain the main purpose of the system, as well as additional subsystems, the interface of these systems, and what they will and will not do, as well as the constraints. Providing a detailed requirement specification of the system as a whole. It is intended for the Client, as well as developers who will integrate the system.}
    	\subsection{Scope}
        	\paragraph{NavUP will be a mobile device application, that will provide the basic functionalities of a navigation system. The system will only interoperate and function on the Hatfield main campus of the University of Pretoria.  	NavUp will provide a means to navigate the main campus of the University of Pretoria. It will thus provide users choices with regards to which routes they wish to take to reach there destination, taking into account factors such as pedestrian and vehicle traffic as well as providing routes that cater to users who may suffer physical disabilities.  NavUP's goal is to provide a personalised, efficient and convenient means of traversing the university's Hatfield campus. The system will also provide extra additional information regarding useful points of interests such as bathroom locations, as well as provide information to the user regarding the rich history of the University of Pretoria. The navigation system will be required to constantly be connected the the campus's WI-FI and will continually send up and down stream information to a server with regards to users location and destination. The server will be required to calculate the route and factor in additional information as set up by the user and there needs. The server must also be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users and provide them all with there required data. Location tracking will be achieved through the use of --WI-FI signal strength and other : not sure of exact methodology-- techniques and not through the use of GPS. /* This means that the two way communication between the device and the server must --explain requirements here-- */ }

        	\subsubsection{System Interface}
            \subsubsection{User Interface}
	    {All users will have access to the navigation system when the application is launched.
They will be able to enter a destination and follow the path to location/lecture hall specified(see Figure 1).
The users will also be able to select preferences such as disability access path, which will enable them to travel the path with ease.\\\\
The users will be able to view information each building, giving them additional historic information about the building(Figure 2). If they do not not wish to 
view information about the building, they must simply not click on the information symbol available.
They will also be allowed to view each room. The navigation system will allow the users to select points of interest, such as food dispensaries, 
smoking locations, and toilets. They will be able to turn on and off indicators for these points of interest.
The users may access a view to heat paths on the map, to show an increase in crowd population in a dense area.\\\\
For the account user interface, the registered students and employees will be able to login to their account, using their clickUP information.
There will be certain accounts with administrative privileges that will be able to create and delete accounts, as deemed necessary.\\\\
The application will be able to send users notifications, on events that occur on campus as well as a report of information, such as the amount of 
steps walked per week. Students and employees will be able to remove push notifications, if they do not wish to receive them from the system.\\\\

            \subsubsection{Hardware Interface}
		\paragraph{
			There will be a hardware interface with the routers across the campus in order to triangulate the position of the user and to create heatmaps. The actual Wi-Fi interface between the phone and Wi-Fi will be abstracted by the phone and will be managed by the actual underlying operatig system on the phone.

		\subsection{Product Functions} \paragraph{The main function of the NavUP system will be to show students how to get around campus in the shortest possible way. Thus, this will entail using WiFi, mobile networks and possibly GPS to navigate around Hatfield campus. The basic functions will include:  }
	\begin{itemize}
  		\item A heat map to show pedestrian traffic.
		\item Providing the shortest path from point A to point B.
 		 \item A distance tracker to show users the distance left until they reach their destination.
		\item A specialized route for disabled users.
		\item Points of interest around the university such as restaurants, ATMs, the church, Scienza and Botanical Gardens.
 		 \item Essential Areas such as bathrooms, parking areas and smoking areas.
		\item Exact locations of buildings as well as the lecture halls that they consist of.
		\item A "Where am i?" function to show users exactly what is around them.
 		 \item Historical backgrounds of buildings and different parts of campus.
		\item A login page for users who would like access to more of the personalised functions. Theses functions will be saving locations for future use, a game which rewards users when they reach a certain distance and saving user preferences and interests.
		\item A random facts generator for distance rewards.
		\item Switching between WiFi, mobile data and GPS to navigate around campus.
		\item A timetable function for users to input their timetables and show exactly where their lectures will take place with reminders.
		\item Provide adminitrative security for login functionality.
		\item Rating system and review for restaurants and parking.
		\item Route options such as scenic routes and fastest route.
		\item Ability to share directions as well as estimated time of arrival.
